            generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Service (the &ldquo;Analytics
            Information&rdquo;) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics
            Information to compile reports on user activity, which we may receive on an individual or aggregate basis.
            We use the information we get from Analytics Services to improve our Service. The Analytics Services may
            also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties
            process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services&rsquo; ability to use and share
            Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services&rsquo; terms of use and privacy policy. By
